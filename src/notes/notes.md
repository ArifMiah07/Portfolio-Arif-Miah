# In this portfolio building process i have learned few things --
    - 1st make a lightweight | sitemap Document about the website and pages if possible then make a complete structural editable or changeable Document
    - 2nd make a Structural Skeleton Design following lightweight Document or if possible then make a complete Design (Actual Desire Design) based on the completed website documents
    - 3rd make a base responsive structure of the website or pages
    - 4th now make every components of the websites and then make them responsive too for all devices
    - follow universal design rules first --- experiments or something uniques could be done later in a comfortable time  
    - before building website or designing or writing documents, thinks first, think deeply, think about past, think about future, think about presents. Do same things while building, designing and writing.
    - be serious, take notes, make a todo list for every working hour, take a isolated break while passing break times, most successful good target is 8 hours straight working while talking 5 - 15 mins every hour with an optional long 30 min breaks for in between two hours work. after done 8 hours of target now u can do anything...spend max 8 hours for sleeping rest for 2 hours do learn or explore or work for more 2 hours and do your personal necessary works for 4 hours.
    - be real and no more illusional delusion or fake imagination or fake expectations ---> if you really want a professional career, Do hard work every day until you, your family, friends, and relatives are satisfied with you.
    - ok, ok...now im going beyond singularity, no more unrealistic ...
    - end
